Subject: [PATCH 1001/1009] selftests/lkdtm: Avoid needing explicit sub-shell

Some environments do not set $SHELL when running tests. There's no
need to use $SHELL here anyway, since "cat" can be used to receive any
delivered signals from the kernel. Additionally avoid using bash-isms
in the command, and record stderr for posterity.
